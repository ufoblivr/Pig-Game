        <p>
          The game is a simple two-player dice game called "Pig Game." The
          objective of the game is to be the first player to reach a score of 50
          or more points. Players take turns rolling a dice and accumulating
          points. If a player rolls a 1, they lose their current score and the
          turn passes to the other player. If a player chooses to "Hold," their
          current score is added to their total score, and they pass the turn to
          the other player.
